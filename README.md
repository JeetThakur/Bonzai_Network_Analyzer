# Bonzai_Network_Analyzer
This Project is a part of the academic curriculum at RIT under the Computer Networks Course  

The Following Python Program is a working simulation to the idea proposed in the SIGCOM Paper
Bonzai Network Analyzer. 
This Python program works on a network topology graph
The Source - Destination pairs are to be specified clearly
when you run the code without which this code will break

The graph after successful completion of the code execution is reduced as per the methods
listed in the Paper mentioned above.

This provides us with a abstracted graph of the original topology.

The program can be tested on any topology - Ring, Star, Fat-tree, etc
The program will provide the user with a clean abstraction

This can be used to do multiple network analysis on the original network topology

Dependencies:
1 - Graph of the original network topology
2 - The source and destination end-points of the network

The output:
Is an abstracted graph

We have attached many other dumps of our mininet working simulations to help you understand this better.
